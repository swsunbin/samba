# gitlab runners with kernel 5.15.109+
# allow setxattr() on security.NTACL
#
# It's not clear in detail why there's a difference
# between various systems, one reason could be that
# with selinux inode_owner_or_capable() is used to check
# setxattr() permissions:
# it checks for the fileowner too, as well as CAP_FOWNER.
# Otherwise cap_inode_setxattr() is used, which checks for
# CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
#
# But the kernel doesn't have selinux only apparmor...
#
# test_setntacl_forcenative expects
# PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
#
# So for now we allow this to fail...
