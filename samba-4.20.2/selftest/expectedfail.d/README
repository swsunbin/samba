# Files in this directory contain lists of regular expressions
# matching the names of tests that are *necessarily* expected to fail.
#
# "make test" will not report failures for tests listed here and will
# consider a successful run for any of these tests an error.
#
# They differ from the knownfail tests (selftest/knownfail.d) in that
# the lack of failure here is definitely a problem. The knownfail
# tests might be fixed one day, even accidentally, but these ones will
# not.
#
# Before adding tests here, consider rewriting the test so that the
# expected result is a failure. The tests in here are typically
# testing the use of some protocol or feature on a server that has
# that feature turned off. The same tests will also be run against
# another server where they do not fail. The downside of this method
# is we don't know that these expected fail tests are failing in the
# right way.
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
#
# Please don't add tests to this README!
