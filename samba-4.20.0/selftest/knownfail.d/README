# Files in this directory contain lists of regular expressions
# matching the names of tests that are temporarily expected to fail.
#
# Tests that are intended to *always* fail (e.g. to prove that the
# test can't succeed under certain conditions) should be added under
# selftest/expectedfail.d instead.
#
# "make test" will not report failures for tests listed here and will consider
# a successful run for any of these tests an error.
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
# Please don't add tests to this README!
