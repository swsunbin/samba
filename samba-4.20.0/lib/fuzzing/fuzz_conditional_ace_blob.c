	 * For example, a blob with a single literal integer token,

	 * "(42)", but when the compiler reads that it knows that a
	 * literal number is invalid except in a RHS argument, so it
	 * assumes "42" is a local attribute name.
	 *
	 * Even if the decompiler was a perfect verifier, a round trip
	 * through SDDL could not be guaranteed because, for example,
	 * an 8 bit integer can only be displayed in SDDL in the form
	 * that compiles to a 64 bit integer.
